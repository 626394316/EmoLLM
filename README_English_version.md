**EmoLLM** is a series of large language models designed to understand, support and help customers in mental health counseling. It is fine-tuned from the LLM instructions. We really appreciate it if you can give it a star~‚≠ê‚≠ê. The open-sourced configuration is as follows:

|         model          |   type   |

The Model is aimed at fully understanding and promoting the mental health of individuals, groups, and society. This model typically includes the following key components:

-  Cognitive factors: Involving an individual's thought patterns, belief systems, cognitive biases, and problem-solving abilities. Cognitive factors significantly impact mental health as they affect how individuals interpret and respond to life events.
- Emotional factors: Including emotion regulation, emotional expression, and emotional experiences. Emotional health is a crucial part of mental health, involving how individuals manage and express their emotions and how they recover from negative emotions.
- Behavioral factors: Concerning an individual's behavior patterns, habits, and coping strategies. This includes stress management skills, social skills, and self-efficacy, which is the confidence in one's abilities.
- Social environment: Comprising external factors such as family, work, community, and cultural background, which have direct and indirect impacts on an individual's mental health.
- Physical health: There is a close relationship between physical and mental health. Good physical health can promote mental health and vice versa.
- Psychological resilience: Refers to an individual's ability to recover from adversity and adapt. Those with strong psychological resilience can bounce back from challenges and learn and grow from them.
- Prevention and intervention measures: The Mental Health Grand Model also includes strategies for preventing psychological issues and promoting mental health, such as psychological education, counseling, therapy, and social support systems.
- Assessment and diagnostic tools: Effective promotion of mental health requires scientific tools to assess individuals' psychological states and diagnose potential psychological issues.
### Recent Updates
- „Äê2024.2.29„Äë Updated objective assessment calculations, see [evaluate](./evaluate/) for details. A series of datasets have also been updated, see [datasets](./datasets/) for details.
- „Äê2024.2.27„Äë Updated English README and a series of datasets (licking dogs and one-round dialogue)
- „Äê2024.2.23„ÄëThe "Gentle Lady Psychologist Ai Wei" based on InternLM2_7B_chat_qlora was launched. [Click here to obtain the model weights](https://openxlab.org.cn/models/detail/ajupyter/EmoLLM_aiwei), [configuration file](xtuner_config/aiwei-internlm2_chat_7b_qlora.py), [online experience link](https://openxlab.org.cn/apps/detail/ajupyter/EmoLLM-aiwei)

- „Äê2024.2.23„ÄëUpdated [several fine-tuning configurations](/xtuner_config/), added [data_pro.json](/datasets/data_pro.json) (more quantity, more comprehensive scenarios, richer content) and [aiwei.json](/datasets/aiwei.json) (dedicated to the gentle lady role-play, featuring Emoji expressions), the "Gentle Lady Psychologist Ai Wei" is coming soon.

- „Äê2024.2.18„Äë The full fine-tuned version based on Qwen1_5-0_5B-Chat has been [open-sourced](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/aJupyter/EmoLLM_Qwen1_5-0_5B-Chat_full_sft/summary). Friends with limited computational resources can now dive in and explore it.

- „Äê2024.2.6„Äë [Open-sourced based on the Qwen1_5-0_5B-Chat full-scale fine-tuned version](https://www.modelscope.cn/models/aJupyter/EmoLLM_Qwen1_5-0_5B-Chat_full_sft/summary), friends with limited computing power can start experimenting~
